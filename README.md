# TB16Pix

A Discreet Global Grid.

This is an instance of the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.ogc.org/) 's "[OGC API - Features](http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0)" API that delivers the authoritative content for the *Testbed 16 Pix* (TB16PIx) which is a [Discreet Global Grid](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/as/15-104r5/15-104r5.html#4), that is, a multi-layered, tessellated, set of spatial grid cells used for position identification on the Earth's surface.

This API and the data within it have been created for the OGC's Testbed 16 which is a multi-organisation interoperability experiment.

***This system is incomplete and will be added to continuously in the second half of 2020.***
